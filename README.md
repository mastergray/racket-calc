##Racket-Calc##
A Racket program that takes an infix arithmetic expression from command line input and returns the result of evalutating that expression back to the command line.
#Features#
 - Arithmetic expressions are parsed using an extended BNF grammar (thanks to [BRAG] (http://docs.racket-lang.org/brag/))
 - Supports +, -, /, *, (, and ) operations
 - Supports operator precedence
 - Supports decimal numbers
 - Typing "q" stops the program
#Why Do This?#
It was my first attempt doing a lot of things I wanted to try - experiment with Racket, experiment with a [BNF] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) (or [extended BNF] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)) grammar, try to evaluate infix expressions without stack arithmetic, or implmenting some variant of Dijkstra's [shunting-yard algorithm] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) or having to build a tokenizer/parser by hand, and to see how well a Racket program could compile down to a stand alone exectutable.
#How To Run This Thing#
To run racket-calc, find wherever you extracted the .tgz to and the binary should be /bin. Once there you would type`./calc`. Because racket-calc was compiled for distibution on a Linux machine, it's binary is said to [only run on other Linux machines] (https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/exe.html). Though the binary itself has only been tested on Ubuntu (specifically Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS running from crouton on a Chromebook - because I'm clearly insane). If, for some reason you wanted to compile the source yourself on some other platform, this _should_ be as easy as loading **calc.rtk** into **DrRacket** and clicking **Racket** > **Create  Exectuable** with **Distribution** selected - as long as all source files are still in the same directory. Add an icon if you're feeling especially ambitious.
#Project Outline#
|-> build (Build files generated by DrRacket for distribution)
|-> dist (A .tgz of the build files generated by DrRacket)
|-> src
  |-> calc.rtk (Defines main program)
  |-> calc-expander.rtk (Module that evalutates an arithmetic expression as a parsed syntax object)
  |-> calc-grammar. (Defines grammar used by the BRAG parser)
  |-> cal-reader.rtk (Module that transforms an arithmetic expression string into a parsed syntax object)
|-> README.md (Seriously?)
#Acknowledgments#
- Decimal results are only returned if inputs have decimal values (so 1/2 would return _1/2_ but 1.5+.5 would return _2.0_)
- No exponents supported yet _(sorry math)_
- Any run-time error that gets thrown will cause the program to terminate (exception handling is something I am stil aspiring towards)
